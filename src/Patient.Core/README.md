# Patient.Core

The `Patient.Core` project contains the domain layer of the application. It is independent of all other layers and contains the core business logic and entities.

## Contents

- **Entities**: Domain entities like `Patient` and `Name`.
- **Value Objects**: Domain value objects like `Gender`.
- **Exceptions**: Domain-specific exceptions.

## Principles

This layer follows the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, ensuring that the business rules are encapsulated within the domain models.
